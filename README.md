# Hello, world.

This is my first fully completed, non-satic website. It's a portfolio/personal website.

You can find the GitHub Pages release at [queenkirathepansexualpixie.github.io](https://queenkirathepansexualpixie.github.io/).

> [!NOTE] Disclaimer:
> The website is not currently working â€“ I'm having some trouble deploying the trunk app with GitHub Workflows.
