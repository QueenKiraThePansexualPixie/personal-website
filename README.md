# Hello, world.

This is my first fully completed, non-satic website. It's a portfolio/personal website.

You can find the GitHub Pages release at [queenkirathepansexualpixie.github.io/personal-website](https://queenkirathepansexualpixie.github.io/personal-website/). (Not currently working)

## Credits

A big thanks to reddit u/Plippe and u/Siref, as well as u/Siref's post, [How to deploy your Yew WASM project into GitHub pages using GitHub actions](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust/comments/13w47uq/how_to_deploy_your_yew_wasm_project_into_github/) for (indirectly) helping me get a start on setting up the Yew project on GitHub Pages. Then also for (again, indirectly) pointing me to [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/10eiysf/comment/j4rmeum/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) by u/Plippe, which led me Plippe's [blog post](https://plippe.github.io/blog/2021/07/12/rust-wasm-github.html) on setting up GitHub actions for a Rust WASM site on GitHub Pages.
